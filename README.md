# IPL-Score-Keeping-
Created as an assignment from Social Cops

This is an attempt to facilitate IPL Score Keeping and updating people with the match schedules.
I have used HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Bootstrap for front end and I plan to manipulate data using Pandas( using Python) so that we can retreive the data from backend and use Vue.js as the framework for web application.
